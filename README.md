Bacteria-Phage Interaction Model with Protection Layers Overview This project simulates the interaction between bacterial populations and their respective phages over time, accounting for the influence of bacterial protection layers and phage countermeasures. The model utilizes a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to capture the dynamics of both species, and the results are presented through time-series plots.

Parameters beta0: Maximum growth rate for bacteria. C_beta: Coefficient that modifies bacterial growth rate based on protection layers. K: Environmental carrying capacity for bacteria. alpha0: Base attack rate of phages on bacteria. C_alpha: Coefficient that adjusts attack rate based on bacterial protection. chi0: Maximum growth rate for phages. C_chi: Coefficient adjusting phage growth based on countermeasures. delta: Phage mortality rate. Bseed: Initial population of bacteria. Pseed: Initial population of phages. Output The simulation generates two plots:

Bacteria Populations Over Time: Shows the evolution of bacterial populations considering various protection strategies. Phage Populations Over Time: Displays the evolution of phage populations in response to bacterial protection and countermeasures. Requirements Python 3.x NumPy Matplotlib Seaborn SciPy Usage Simply run the script in a Python environment to generate the plots. Modify the parameters to explore different scenarios for bacterial and phage interactions.
